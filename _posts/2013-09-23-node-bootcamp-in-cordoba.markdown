We did our [Node.js Bootcamp for Startups](http://nodejsbootcamp.com/) for the third time, this time in Córdoba- Argentina. 

We were really excited to see the interest and the enthusiasm in Córdoba. Forty people joined the workshop from Córdoba but also from other provinces and stayed coding like crazy for 8 hours and making very good questions about the sample application.

Since our limit for this event was 40 sits we know plenty of you lost the change to participate but don't worry we are planning more events like this, stay in sync for upcoming news.

Also we want to thanks our awesome sponsors [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/), [GitHub](http://github.com), [StrongLoop](http://strongloop.com) and [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) for participating in this event and contributing with wonderful material.
