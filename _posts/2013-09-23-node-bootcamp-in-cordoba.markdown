We hosted a [Node.js Bootcamp](http://nodejsbootcamp.com/) last Friday. This time it was at [Córdoba, Argentina](https://maps.google.com.ar/maps?q=cordoba+argentina&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sll=-34.625863,-58.433533&sspn=0.42942,0.845261&hnear=C%C3%B3rdoba,+C%C3%B3rdoba+Province&t=m&z=12). This is the third time we do an event like this and it's getting better and better :)

We were really excited to see the interest and enthusiasm this generated in Córdoba. Fourty hackers, students, startup devs attended. People came mostly from Córdoba but also from other provinces and spent the whole day learning about node, mongodb, GitHub and things we use to build and operate Auth0. Not only the excitment was at the room but also on Twitter: [100+ tweets over the day](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cbanodebootcamp&src=typd&f=realtime)!

This is a cause really dear to our heart and we don't make any profit out of running the bootcamp, so we would like to thanks [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/), [GitHub](http://github.com), [StrongLoop](http://strongloop.com) and [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) for collaborating on this.

All the content (exercises and slides) is open sourced: https://github.com/auth0/bootcamp-workshop

Follow us on twitter ([https://twitter.com/authzero]) if you want to know when will be the next one.
