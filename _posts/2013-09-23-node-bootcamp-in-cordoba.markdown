Last Friday, we hosted the [Node.js Bootcamp](http://nodejsbootcamp.com/) in [Córdoba City, Argentina](https://maps.google.com.ar/maps?q=cordoba+argentina&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sll=-34.625863,-58.433533&sspn=0.42942,0.845261&hnear=C%C3%B3rdoba,+C%C3%B3rdoba+Province&t=m&z=12). This is the third time we organize  an event like this, and it's getting better and better each time :)

We were really excited to see the high interest and enthusiasm this generated in Córdoba. Fourty hackers, students, startup devs attended. People came mostly from Córdoba but also from other provinces and spent the whole day learning about node, MongoDB, GitHub and things we use to build and operate Auth0. We felt the excitment in the room but also online: [100+ tweets over the day!](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cbanodebootcamp&src=typd&f=realtime)

This is a cause really dear to our heart and we don't make any profit out of running the bootcamp. We simply love what we do and want to share it with more people. We would like to thank [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/), [GitHub](http://github.com), [StrongLoop](http://strongloop.com) and [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) for joining us as sponsors. Their contribution allowed us to make this event affordable to everyone. Attendees loved the books, content and other goodies they sent as well. Thanks!

Interested in the content? Everything (exercises and slides) is [open sourced and you can access it on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0/bootcamp-workshop).

Very likely we will have more of these coming in the next months. [Follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/authzero) to learn more. Also, let us know if you have suggestions on place, or topics; or if you would like to participate in the next one. [All feedback is very welcome!](mailto:bootcamp@auth0.com)

Some excerpts from the survey we've sent afterwards:

* 90% of attendees were very or extremely satisfied with the bootcamp
* 100% would recommend this bootcamp to others

A few quotes from (translated from Spanish):

> "...As a Startup CTO you gave me a lot of ideas/guidelines on where to work on"

> "Excelent bootcamp. I ended up with my head full of knowledge and planning to try a lot of things."

> "The bootcamp was great. I'm very happy I've decided to come. I loved the final hour with examples using TeamCity and GitHub"

> "It was great go through different topics, hands-on, and see how each thing relates to each other. Congratulations!!"
